  Sooo, this is pretty much just a text file. 
  I don't know what to say about it. 
  I guess you can just read it and see what happens. 
  I mean, it's not like there's anything special about it or anything. 
  It's just a text file, you know? 
  But hey, if you're reading this, then I guess you must be pretty bored or something. 
  So, uh, thanks for stopping by? I guess? Anyway, I hope you have a great day! Bye!

  If you like pizza, then you'll love this text file! 
  It's like a pizza party in your brain! 
  And if you don't like pizza, well, I guess you can just pretend it's a salad or something. 
  But who wants to read a salad? Not me! 
  So let's just stick with the pizza analogy, okay? 
  Cool. Thanks for reading! <span class="bye"><a class="bye" href="https://c.tenor.com/DPIzkhJUDUsAAAAC/tenor.gif" target="_blank">Bye!</a></span>
